## Features

📌  *`Wallet`* - You can have a deposit and withdrawal wallet to manage *KLAY* in the contract.

📌  *`Stake`* - You can stake KLAY in your wallet. You'll get the same amount of LKLAY.
> Governance stock (LIL) is issued in proportion to the number of LKLAYs held by the user.  
> LIL can be used to discount fees incurred within the service. Fees are currently incurred in Donation and Withdrawal.

📌 *`Upload Video`* - You can earn nft by posting your own video on our website.
> Tokenizing videos to NFT will allow creators to retain ownership of videos, regardless of service retention.  
> In addition, the video is uploaded to IPFS, not to a private platform, so anyone who knows the CID can watch it forever.  
> Creators can earn continuous advertising revenue by holding ownership, or generate revenue by selling ownership.

📌 *`Donation`* - All users can donate to their favorite creator by simply clicking and entering a value.
> KLAY sent by the user to the creator will be stored in the creator's wallet.  
> Creators can take money out of their wallets at any time and save on withdrawal fees using LIL.  

📌 *`Upload Ads`* - Advertisers can easily upload their own ads using `Lillybox`.
> Tokenize ads with NFT, and through smart contracts, advertisers can upload ads directly.   
> Advertisers can dramatically reduce advertising costs by skipping intermediate courses. It's just same as uploading video!  
> Tokenized ads will burn if the view count exceeds the amount paid for the ad upload.

🏃‍🏃‍🏃‍♂️`Live Streaming` and `Chat Server` are under development. 🏃‍🏃‍🏃‍♂️
